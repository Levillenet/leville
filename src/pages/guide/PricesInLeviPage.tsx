      q: "Do I need cash in Levi?",

    {
      q: "Is Levi expensive compared to Alpine resorts?",
      a: "Ski passes and equipment rental are cheaper in Levi than most Alpine destinations. Food is comparable. The biggest difference is alcohol — drinks in Finnish restaurants are noticeably more expensive than in Austria or France due to Finnish alcohol taxation.",
    },
    {
      q: "When is Levi cheapest?",

    },

      q: "What currency is used in Levi?",
      a: "Finland uses the euro (€). No currency exchange is needed if you're coming from another eurozone country.",

    {
      q: "Should I book activities in advance?",
      a: "Yes, especially during Christmas, New Year and Finnish winter holiday weeks (late Feb – early March). Popular activities like husky safaris sell out days in advance. Book directly with local operators for the best prices — you'll typically save 20–30% compared to booking through tour operators.",

      q: "Can I bring my own alcohol?",

            Christmas–New Year is the most expensive week — prices can be 2–3× normal rates. Finnish school holiday weeks (weeks 8–10) are also popular. The cheapest times are January (polar night) and April (spring skiing).

            <strong>Money-saving tip:</strong> An apartment or cabin with a self-catering kitchen saves hundreds of euros per week on restaurant bills. Book directly through Leville.net for the best rates.
